# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## General Questions

### Q: What is AutoControl Pro?
**A:** AutoControl Pro is a multi-tenant SaaS application for inventory management, delivery tracking, and business operations. It provides organizations with tools to manage their storage, track deliveries, handle incidents, and monitor business metrics.

### Q: How does multi-tenancy work?
**A:** Each organization has its own isolated data space. Users can only access data belonging to their organization, ensuring complete data privacy and security. Organizations are identified by unique subdomains and internal IDs.

### Q: Can I migrate my existing data?
**A:** Yes, we provide data migration tools to help you import your existing data. The system includes a migration wizard that can handle various data formats and validate the imported information.

## Account and Authentication

### Q: How do I create an account?
**A:** Visit the registration page, provide your email, password, and organization details. You'll receive a verification email to activate your account. Once verified, you can log in and start using the system.

### Q: I forgot my password. How do I reset it?
**A:** Click the "Forgot Password" link on the login page, enter your email address, and you'll receive a password reset link. The link is valid for 1 hour for security reasons.

### Q: How long do login sessions last?
**A:** Login sessions last for 24 hours by default. The system will automatically refresh your token as long as you're actively using the application. You can also manually log out at any time.

### Q: Can I change my email address?
**A:** Currently, email addresses cannot be changed after account creation. If you need to change your email, please contact support for assistance.

### Q: What happens if I enter the wrong password multiple times?
**A:** After 5 failed login attempts, your account will be temporarily locked for 15 minutes to prevent brute force attacks. You can also use the password reset feature if you've forgotten your password.

## Organization Management

### Q: How do I invite users to my organization?
**A:** Go to the User Management page in your organization settings. Click "Invite User," enter their email address, select their role, and send the invitation. They'll receive an email with instructions to join your organization.

**A:** Currently, each user account is associated with one organization. If you need access to multiple organizations, you'll need separate accounts for each.
