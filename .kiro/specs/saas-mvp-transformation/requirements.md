# Requirements Document - SaaS MVP Transformation

## Introduction

Transform the current single-tenant Autocontrol Sanitario Pro application into a professional multi-tenant SaaS platform that can be used by multiple companies independently. The MVP will focus on security, data isolation, and professional authentication while maintaining all existing functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Professional Authentication System

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want a secure and professional login system so that my company data is protected and I can trust the platform with sensitive information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user registers THEN the system SHALL require email verification before account activation
2. WHEN a user forgets their password THEN the system SHALL provide a secure password reset flow via email
3. WHEN a user attempts to login THEN the system SHALL use JWT tokens with proper expiration and refresh mechanisms
4. WHEN a user enters incorrect credentials multiple times THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
5. WHEN user passwords are stored THEN the system SHALL use bcrypt hashing with proper salt rounds
6. WHEN a user session expires THEN the system SHALL automatically redirect to login without data loss

### Requirement 2: Multi-Tenant Architecture

**User Story:** As a SaaS platform owner, I want each company to have completely isolated data so that businesses can use the platform without seeing other companies' information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a company registers THEN the system SHALL create a unique organization/tenant identifier
2. WHEN users access data THEN the system SHALL only show data belonging to their organization
3. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL filter all database queries by organization ID
4. WHEN a new user joins THEN they SHALL be associated with a specific organization
5. WHEN organization data is queried THEN there SHALL be no possibility of cross-tenant data leakage
6. WHEN users are created THEN they SHALL inherit the organization context from the creator or invitation

### Requirement 3: Organization Management

**User Story:** As a company administrator, I want to manage my organization's settings and users so that I can control who has access to our data and how our company information is displayed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an organization is created THEN it SHALL have configurable company information (name, address, contact details)
2. WHEN an admin invites users THEN they SHALL be able to assign roles (Admin, User, Read-Only)
3. WHEN organization settings are updated THEN changes SHALL be reflected immediately for all users in that organization
4. WHEN an admin views users THEN they SHALL only see users from their organization
5. WHEN a user is deactivated THEN they SHALL lose access immediately but their historical data SHALL remain
6. WHEN an organization is created THEN it SHALL have a unique subdomain or identifier for branding

### Requirement 4: Enhanced Security Measures

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want my data to be secure and protected so that I can confidently store sensitive business information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is transmitted THEN the system SHALL use HTTPS encryption for all communications
2. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL validate and sanitize all input data
3. WHEN sensitive operations are performed THEN the system SHALL log security events for audit purposes
4. WHEN tokens are issued THEN they SHALL have appropriate expiration times and be properly validated
5. WHEN user sessions are managed THEN the system SHALL implement proper session security measures
6. WHEN database connections are made THEN they SHALL use secure connection strings and proper authentication

### Requirement 5: Data Migration and Compatibility

**User Story:** As a current user of the application, I want my existing data to be preserved and accessible after the SaaS transformation so that I don't lose any historical records.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is upgraded THEN existing localStorage data SHALL be migrated to the new multi-tenant structure
2. WHEN legacy data is encountered THEN the system SHALL provide migration utilities to convert it to the new format
3. WHEN users first login after upgrade THEN they SHALL be guided through any necessary data migration steps
4. WHEN data migration occurs THEN all existing functionality SHALL remain intact
5. WHEN historical data is accessed THEN it SHALL maintain the same structure and relationships as before
6. WHEN migration is complete THEN users SHALL be able to continue working without interruption

### Requirement 6: Professional User Experience

**User Story:** As a business user, I want a professional and polished interface so that the application reflects well on my business and is easy to use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

3. WHEN users navigate the application THEN they SHALL see their organization name and branding
4. WHEN users perform actions THEN they SHALL receive clear feedback about success or failure
5. WHEN the application loads THEN it SHALL display loading states and progress indicators where appropriate
6. WHEN users access help or support THEN they SHALL find clear documentation and contact information

### Requirement 7: Scalable Infrastructure Foundation

**User Story:** As a SaaS platform owner, I want the infrastructure to be scalable and maintainable so that the platform can grow with increasing user demand.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is deployed THEN it SHALL use a cloud-based database solution (MongoDB Atlas)
2. WHEN traffic increases THEN the system SHALL be designed to handle horizontal scaling
3. WHEN backups are needed THEN the system SHALL have automated backup procedures in place
4. WHEN monitoring is required THEN the system SHALL include basic health checks and error tracking
5. WHEN updates are deployed THEN the system SHALL support zero-downtime deployments
6. WHEN performance issues arise THEN the system SHALL have logging and monitoring to identify bottlenecks
